# CIST2110-001-Project-3 Library Management System (LMS)
# Project 3 will implement a library management system (LMS) that will allow users to manage books, users, and a library to manage collection of books and users.
# The LMS will be menu driven and will allow users to add, delete, and update books and users.
# Users will also be able to borrow and return books.
# The LMS will also allow users to search for books and users.

# ENABLE WORD WRAP TO MAKE THINGS EASIER TO READ:
# VIEW (at the top) -> WORD WRAP

# Import statements:

# Project outline and requirements:

# OUTLINE - The LMS will consist of the following classes and methods:

# 1. Create a Book class that has the following attributes (create a __init__ method)):
#    a. ISBN (int)
#    b. Title (string)
#    c. Author (string)
#    d. borrowed (boolean) - this should not be passed in as a parameter, it should be set to False by default
# USE SELF IN THE __INIT__ METHOD TO CREATE THESE ATTRIBUTES

# Methods:
#    a. __str__ (returns a string representation of the book using the following format: ISBN: <ISBN>, Title: <Title>, Author: <Author>, Borrowed: <Borrowed>)
#    b. checkout - sets borrowed to True and returns a message that the book has been checked out
#    c. checkin - sets borrowed to False and returns a message that the book has been checked in
#    d. isBorrowed - returns True if the book is borrowed and False if the book is not borrowed


# 2. Create a User class that has the following attributes (create a __init__ method)):
#    a. Name (string)
#    c. ID (int)
#   d. borrowedBooks (list of books)
# USE SELF IN THE __INIT__ METHOD TO CREATE THESE ATTRIBUTES

# Methods:
#    a. __str__ (returns a string representation of the user using the following format: Name: <Name>, ID: <ID>, Borrowed Books: <Borrowed Books>)
#    b. borrow_book - adds the book to the borrowedBooks list, updates the isBorrowed attribute of the book to True, and returns a message that the book has been checked out (should take a book as a parameter)
#    c. return_book - removes the book from the borrowedBooks list, updates the isBorrowed attribute of the book to False, and returns a message that the book has been checked in (should take a book as a parameter)

# 3. Create a Library class that has the following attributes (create a __init__ method)):
#    a. books (list of books)
#    b. users (list of users)
# USE SELF IN THE __INIT__ METHOD TO CREATE THESE ATTRIBUTES

# Methods:
#    a. __str__ (returns a string representation of the library using the following format: Books: <Books>, Users: <Users>)
#    b. add_book - adds a book to the books list (should take a book as a parameter)
#    c. add_user - adds a user to the users list (should take a user as a parameter)
#    d. find_book - returns the book with the given ISBN (should take an ISBN as a parameter)
#    e. find_user - returns the user with the given ID (should take an ID as a parameter)
#    f. export_books_to_csv - exports the books list to a csv file (should take a filename as a parameter)
#       The csv file should have the following format: ISBN,Title,Author,Borrowed
#       The csv.DictWriter class is very useful for this: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter
#    g. export_users_to_csv - exports the users list to a csv file (should take a filename as a parameter)
#       This will be similar to the export_books_to_csv method but there is a slight difference with the borrowedBooks attribute if you get stuck this code might help:
#       borrowed_books_titles = [book.title for book in user.borrowed_books]
#       Use that and pythons .join method to create a string of the borrowed books titles

# 4. Create a menu that will allow users to:
#    a. Add books
#    b. Add users
#    c. Delete books
#    d. Delete users
#    g. Borrow books
#    h. Return books
#    i. Search books
#    j. Check if book is available
#    k. Search users
#    l. Export books to csv
#    m. Export users to csv
#    z. Exit

# RQUIREMENTS:
# 1. You should be doing error checking on all user input (make sure the user enters a valid ISBN, ID, etc.) and handle any errors appropriately (i.e. if the user enters an invalid ISBN, ask them to enter a valid ISBN)
# 2. You should be using try except blocks to handle any errors
# 3. You should be using the classes and methods outlined above with the exact names and parameters
# 4. You should be using the menu to call the appropriate methods
# 5. There is a Project3Tests.py file that will help you test your code. You should be able to run that file and pass all the tests.
#    Remember to run pytest use the following command in the terminal: pytest Project3Tests.py
# 6. The Project3Tests.py file is missing 2 tests. test_user_return and test_library_find_user. You will need to implement those tests and ensure they pass.
# 7. In your main method you should create a library object first to use for the rest of the program. You should not be creating a new library object every time you call a method. (Similar to the Store object in Lab 11)
# 8. In your main method you should be using a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.

# IMPORTANT: You will only have 1 submission for this project so make sure you test your code thoroughly before submitting.

# You will be graded on the following:
# 1. Did you follow the project outline and requirements?
# 2. Does your code run without errors?
# 3. Did you use try except blocks to handle errors?
# 4. Did you use the classes and methods outlined above with the exact names and parameters?
# 5. Did you use the menu to call the appropriate methods?
# 6. Did you include docstrings for all classes and methods?
# 7. Did you include type hints for all methods?
# 8. Did your pytests for the test_user_return and test_library_find_user work?
